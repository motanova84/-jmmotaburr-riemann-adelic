\section{Paley-Wiener Theory with Multiplicities}

\subsection{Classical Paley-Wiener Theorem}

[To be completed: Statement and proof of classical Paley-Wiener theorem for entire functions of exponential type.]

\subsection{Extension with Multiplicities}

[To be completed: Strengthened version accounting for multiplicity of zeros, determining classes, and uniqueness criteria.]

\subsection{Application to $D(s)$ and $\Xi(s)$}

[To be completed: Verification that $D(s)$ and $\Xi(s)$ belong to the same determining class, matching zeros with multiplicities.]
