\section{Hilbert Space Construction}

\subsection{Overview}

[To be completed: Construction of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ from S-finite adelic functions, inner product definition, completeness, and density of Schwartz-Bruhat functions.]

\subsection{Local Hilbert Spaces}

[To be completed: Definition of $\mathcal{H}_v$ for each place $v$, factorization $\mathcal{H} = \bigotimes_v \mathcal{H}_v$, and tensor product structure.]

\subsection{Trace-Class Properties}

[To be completed: Proof that local operators are trace-class, estimates on operator norms, and convergence of infinite products.]
