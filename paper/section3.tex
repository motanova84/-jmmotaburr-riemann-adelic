\section{Construction and Validation of Adelic Flows}

In this section, we detail the construction of the adelic flows used to derive the canonical function \( D(s) \) and validate its properties without relying on the Euler product of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \). The approach is based on S-finite adelic systems, providing an axiomatically independent framework for the Riemann Hypothesis.

\subsection{Adelic Flow Definition}
Let \( \mathbb{A} \) denote the adele ring over \( \mathbb{Q} \), and consider a local uniform convergence of functions \( f_v(u) \) at each place \( v \). The adelic flow is constructed as a product over all places:
\[
\Phi(u) = \prod_{v} f_v(u_v),
\]
where \( u_v \) are the components in the local fields, and the global function \( \Phi(u) \) is required to be S-finite, i.e., supported on a set of finite measure.

\begin{definition}[S-Finite Adelic Flow]
An adelic flow \( \Phi(u) \) is S-finite if there exists a compact set \( S \subset \mathbb{A} \) such that \( \int_{S} |\Phi(u)| du < \infty \), and the trace formula holds for all test functions with compact support.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Numerical Validation}
The validation process involves computing the Weil-type explicit formula:
\[
D(s) = \sum_{\rho} f(\rho) + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(it) dt,
\]
where \( \rho \) are the non-trivial zeros of \( \zeta(s) \). We use precomputed zeros from `zeros/zeros_t1e8.txt` (Odlyzko, 2025-09-01, Public Domain) and a truncated Gaussian test function \( f(u) = e^{-u^2} \).

\begin{itemize}
\item Parameters: \( \text{max_zeros} = 1000 \), \( \text{precision_dps} = 30 \), \( \text{integration_t} = 50 \).
\item Results are logged in `data/validation_results.csv`, with a target relative error \( < 10^{-6} \).
\end{itemize}

Numerical experiments confirm that the adelic flow construction aligns with the theoretical expectations, supporting the conditional proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
