# CI Workflow Conflict Resolution

## Problem
The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file had merge conflicts between two branches:
- `copilot/fix-ci-workflow-conflicts`: Focused on matrix testing and caching
- `main`: Focused on metadata validation and conversion testing

## Solution
Created a unified CI workflow that combines the best features from both versions.

## Key Features of Resolved Workflow

### From `copilot/fix-ci-workflow-conflicts`
1. **Matrix Strategy**: Tests across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
2. **Pip Caching**: Speeds up builds by caching pip dependencies
3. **Comprehensive Linting**: 
   - flake8 for code quality checks
   - black for code formatting
   - isort for import sorting
4. **Flexible Linting**: Uses `continue-on-error: true` to provide feedback without blocking

### From `main`
1. **Metadata Validation**: Validates JSON-LD metadata using `tools/verify_metadata.py`
2. **Conversion Testing**: Runs smoke tests for Lean to intermediate conversion
3. **Conditional Execution**: Conversion tests only run on pull requests

### Improvements
1. **Upgraded Actions**: Updated from `actions/setup-python@v4` to `@v5`
2. **Consistent Caching**: Added pip caching to all jobs
3. **Parallel Execution**: Removed redundant `setup` job and job dependencies
4. **Security**: Added top-level `permissions: contents: read`

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    # Runs on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (matrix)
    # - Linting (flake8, black, isort)
    # - Unit tests with pytest
    
  validate-metadata:
    # Runs independently
    # - Validates metadata JSON-LD files
    
  verify-conversion:
    # Runs only on pull requests
    # - Tests Lean to intermediate conversion
```

## Benefits
- **Faster CI**: Jobs run in parallel instead of sequentially
- **Better Coverage**: Tests on multiple Python versions
- **More Efficient**: Caching reduces build times
- **Non-blocking Linting**: Provides feedback without failing builds
- **Comprehensive**: Includes linting, testing, metadata validation, and conversion testing

## Testing
- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Metadata validation tool tested successfully
- ✅ Conversion tool tested successfully
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities found (CodeQL)
- ✅ Linting tools verified
