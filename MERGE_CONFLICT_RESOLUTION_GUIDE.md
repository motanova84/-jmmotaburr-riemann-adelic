# Merge Conflict Resolution Guide - requirements.txt

## Overview

This document explains the merge conflict resolution that was performed on `requirements.txt` between the `copilot/fix-d646048e-c204-4897-abb5-cd020b7ef29c` branch and `main` branch.

## The Conflict

The merge conflict occurred because:

1. **Copilot branch** attempted to add:
   ```
   # Parallel computation
   joblib>=1.3.0
   ```
   This was a **duplicate entry** since `joblib>=1.3.0` already existed at line 17 under "# Parallel computing".

2. **Main branch** added:
   - Comprehensive advanced mathematical libraries for acceleration and expansion
   - JIT compilation tools (numba, llvmlite)
   - Machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, xgboost)
   - GPU acceleration (jax, jaxlib)
   - Advanced numerical methods (numexpr, bottleneck)
   - Graph theory tools (networkx, python-igraph)
   - Tensor operations (tensorly, opt-einsum)
   - Statistical tools (statsmodels, patsy)
   - Sparse matrix operations (sparse)
   - Optimization tools (nlopt)

## Resolution Strategy

The correct resolution was to:

1. **Keep** the original `joblib>=1.3.0` entry at line 17 (no duplicate)
2. **Reject** the duplicate joblib entry from the copilot branch
3. **Accept** all advanced mathematical libraries from the main branch

## Final Result

The resolved `requirements.txt` contains:

### Core Dependencies (lines 1-24)
- mpmath==1.3.0
- numpy>=1.22.4,<2.3
- scipy>=1.13.0
- sympy==1.12
- matplotlib>=3.7.0
- jupyter==1.0.0
- nbconvert==7.16.4
- mistune==2.0.5
- requests==2.32.4
- **joblib>=1.3.0** (single occurrence - correct)
- qiskit>=0.45.0
- pytest==8.2.0
- pytest-cov==6.0.0

### Advanced Mathematical Libraries (lines 26-59)
All 16 advanced libraries from the main branch:
- numba>=0.58.0 (JIT compilation)
- llvmlite>=0.41.0 (numba dependency)
- scikit-learn>=1.3.0 (ML algorithms)
- xgboost>=2.0.0 (gradient boosting)
- jax>=0.4.20 (GPU support)
- jaxlib>=0.4.20 (JAX backend)
- numexpr>=2.8.5 (fast expressions)
- bottleneck>=1.3.7 (array operations)
- networkx>=3.1 (graph algorithms)
- python-igraph>=0.10.8 (fast graphs)
- tensorly>=0.8.1 (tensor decomposition)
- opt-einsum>=3.3.0 (Einstein summation)
- statsmodels>=0.14.0 (statistical modeling)
- patsy>=0.5.3 (statistical formulas)
- sparse>=0.14.0 (sparse arrays)
- nlopt>=2.7.1 (optimization)

## Validation

The resolution has been validated to ensure:
- ✅ No duplicate package entries
- ✅ All expected advanced libraries are present
- ✅ joblib appears exactly once
- ✅ Package version specifications are correct
- ✅ Comments and organization are preserved

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Avoid Duplicates**: Never include the same package twice
2. **Preserve Additions**: Keep legitimate new dependencies from both branches
3. **Maintain Organization**: Keep comments and logical grouping intact
4. **Version Consistency**: Ensure version specifications don't conflict

## Related Files

- `requirements.txt` - Main dependencies file (correctly resolved)
- `paper/requirements.txt` - Paper-specific dependencies (separate)
- `setup_environment.py` - Environment setup and validation script

## Validation Script

A validation script (`/tmp/validate_requirements.py`) was created to programmatically verify the resolution:
- Checks for duplicate packages
- Verifies all advanced libraries are present
- Confirms joblib appears only once
- Reports comprehensive validation results
