# Unicode Character Check Fix

## Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow "Check for problematic Unicode characters" was failing with:
```
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

The workflow was supposed to detect problematic Unicode characters in Jupyter notebooks that could cause Python syntax errors.

## Root Causes

1. **Wrong Unicode Characters**: The workflow was checking for regular ASCII quotes (`'` U+0027, `"` U+0022) instead of Unicode curly quotes (`'` U+2018, `'` U+2019, `"` U+201C, `"` U+201D)

2. **Grep Pattern Bug**: The dash characters (`–` U+2013, `—` U+2014) were placed in the middle of the grep character class `[...]`, causing them to be interpreted as range operators, which resulted in false positives matching regular characters like `"` in JSON structure

## Solution

### 1. Updated `.github/workflows/check_unicode.yml`

**Before:**
```bash
PROBLEMATIC_CHARS="≪≫≠≤≥–—''""\""
```
- Contains regular ASCII quotes that are used everywhere in Python code
- Dashes in the middle act as range operators

**After:**
```bash
PROBLEMATIC_CHARS="≪≫≠≤≥''""–—"
```
- Contains actual Unicode curly quotes (U+2018, U+2019, U+201C, U+201D)
- Dashes moved to the end to prevent range operator interpretation

### 2. Updated `fix_unicode.py`

**Before:**
```python
replacements = {
    # ... other chars ...
    ''': "'",     # These were escaped and became regular quotes
    ''': "'",
    '"': '"',
    '"': '"',
}
```

**After:**
```python
replacements = {
    # ... other chars ...
    '\u2018': "'",     # Left single quotation mark
    '\u2019': "'",     # Right single quotation mark
    '\u201C': '"',     # Left double quotation mark
    '\u201D': '"',     # Right double quotation mark
}
```

## Characters to Replace

The workflow now correctly checks for these problematic Unicode characters:

| Unicode | Character | ASCII Equivalent | Description |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| U+226A  | ≪        | <<               | Much less than |
| U+226B  | ≫        | >>               | Much greater than |
| U+2260  | ≠        | !=               | Not equal |
| U+2264  | ≤        | <=               | Less than or equal |
| U+2265  | ≥        | >=               | Greater than or equal |
| U+2013  | –        | -                | En dash |
| U+2014  | —        | -                | Em dash |
| U+2018  | '        | '                | Left single quotation mark |
| U+2019  | '        | '                | Right single quotation mark |
| U+201C  | "        | "                | Left double quotation mark |
| U+201D  | "        | "                | Right double quotation mark |

## Verification

After the fix:
- ✅ Workflow check passes (no problematic Unicode characters found in notebooks)
- ✅ All 5 notebooks have valid JSON structure
- ✅ CodeQL security check: 0 alerts

## Note

The current notebooks in the repository do not contain any of these problematic Unicode characters, which is why the workflow now passes successfully.
