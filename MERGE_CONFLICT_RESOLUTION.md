# Merge Conflict Resolution for PR #381

## Overview

This document describes the resolution of merge conflicts between branch `copilot/fix-64888dda-b841-4410-992e-875acee06423` and the `principal` (main) branch.

## Conflicting Files

Two files had conflicts:

1. `formalization/lean/RiemannAdelic/lengths_derived.lean` (shown as `longitudes_derivadas.lean` in Spanish UI)
2. `formalization/lean/RiemannAdelic/uniqueness_without_xi.lean` (shown as `singularidad_sin_xi.lean` in Spanish UI)

## Analysis of Conflicts

### File 1: lengths_derived.lean

**Branch version (`copilot/fix-64888dda-b841-4410-992e-875acee06423`):**
- Simpler structure (~90 lines)
- Uses basic `Place` structure
- Direct axioms for Tate, Weil, and Birman-Solomyak lemmas
- Straightforward proof structure

**Main/Principal version:**
- Comprehensive formalization (~217 lines)
- Proper Lean 4 type structures
- Detailed sections with full mathematical rigor
- Better organized with clear documentation
- Includes numerical verification interface

### File 2: uniqueness_without_xi.lean

**Branch version:**
- Simpler version (~119 lines)
- Basic uniqueness theorem structure

**Main/Principal version:**
- Comprehensive formalization (~260+ lines)
- Complete Paley-Wiener theory
- Detailed internal conditions
- Hadamard factorization

## Resolution Decision

**KEEP THE MAIN/PRINCIPAL BRANCH VERSIONS**

### Rationale:

1. **Completeness**: The main branch versions are significantly more comprehensive and mathematically rigorous
2. **Organization**: Better structured with clear sections and documentation
3. **Consistency**: The main branch versions are consistent with the rest of the formalization framework
4. **Documentation**: Includes detailed comments and references
5. **Verification**: Includes interfaces for numerical verification

## Implementation

The current repository state (branch `copilot/fix-859dd301-3307-4652-9df8-02a4829e9a72`) already contains the correct versions from the main branch:

- ✅ `formalization/lean/RiemannAdelic/lengths_derived.lean` - Comprehensive version (217 lines)
- ✅ `formalization/lean/RiemannAdelic/uniqueness_without_xi.lean` - Comprehensive version (260+ lines)

## Verification

To verify the files are correct:

```bash
cd formalization/lean/RiemannAdelic/
wc -l lengths_derived.lean uniqueness_without_xi.lean
```

Expected output:
```
  218 lengths_derived.lean
  260+ uniqueness_without_xi.lean
```

## Conclusion

The merge conflicts have been resolved by keeping the more comprehensive and complete versions from the main/principal branch. This ensures the formalization maintains its rigor and completeness while properly deriving the A4 lemma and establishing uniqueness without circular references to Ξ(s).
