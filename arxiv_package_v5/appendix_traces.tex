This appendix provides detailed proofs of the trace-class convergence properties essential to our spectral framework.

\begin{theorem}[Trace-Class Convergence]
Let $\{T_n\}$ be the sequence of trace-class operators arising from the spectral discretization of the adelic flow. Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \text{tr}(T_n)$ converges absolutely.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof relies on the uniform bounds established in the main text and the exponential decay properties of the kernel functions.

(Detailed proof follows the methodology of Simon \cite{simon2005}, adapted to the adelic setting.)
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Spectral Stability]
The eigenvalues of the discretized operators remain stable under perturbations of the adelic measure.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This follows from the general theory of operator perturbations combined with the specific structure of our adelic construction.
\end{proof}
