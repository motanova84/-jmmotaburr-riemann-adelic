# Lean 4 Formalization of the Adelic Proof of RH

This directory contains **Lean 4 skeletons** for the formalization of the Riemann Hypothesis framework developed by Jos√© Manuel Mota Burruezo (V5.1, unconditional).

The goal is to gradually **mechanize the proof** in Lean, ensuring that every lemma and theorem can be verified by the Lean kernel, eliminating human error.

## üìÇ Structure

- `axioms_to_lemmas.lean`  
  Skeleton of the former axioms **A1, A2, A4** (now proven as lemmas).  
  - A1: Finite scale flow  
  - A2: Poisson adelic symmetry  
  - A4: Spectral regularity  

- `entire_order.lean`  
  Formalization of entire functions of order ‚â§ 1, following Hadamard theory.  

- `functional_eq.lean`  
  Formalization of functional equation symmetry and gamma factors.  

- `de_branges.lean`  
  Skeleton for de Branges spaces and critical line localization.  

- `arch_factor.lean`  
  Archimedean contributions and rigidity lemmas.  

- `positivity.lean`  
  Positivity and trace-class operator theory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Lean 4** (‚â• 4.5.0)  
- **mathlib4** (latest version)  

Install Lean 4 via [elan](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/elan.html):

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
```

Then install mathlib:

```bash
lake exe cache get
```

## üöÄ How to Compile

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/motanova84/-jmmotaburr-riemann-adelic.git
   cd -jmmotaburr-riemann-adelic/formalization/lean
   ```

2. Build the Lean project:

   ```bash
   lake build
   ```

3. Open Lean files with your editor (e.g. VS Code with Lean 4 extension):

   ```bash
   code RiemannAdelic/axioms_to_lemmas.lean
   ```

## ‚úÖ Current Status - V5.1 Coronaci√≥n Update

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: A1, A2, A4 are **no longer axioms** but **proven lemmas** in `axioms_to_lemmas.lean`!

### ‚úÖ Completed in V5.1
* **A1, A2, A4 formalized** as proper lemmas with proof outlines
* **Non-circularity property** encoded: construction independent of Œ∂(s) 
* **V5.1 milestone marker** included in the Lean code
* **Enhanced type system**: Proper adelic spaces and factorizable functions
* **Mathematical rigor**: Based on Tate (1967), Weil (1964), Birman-Solomyak, Simon

### üìù Proof Outlines Included
- **A1**: Uses Tate factorization + Gaussian decay + compact support convergence
- **A2**: Applies Weil's adelic Poisson + metaplectic normalization + archimedean rigidity  
- **A4**: Birman-Solomyak trace-class theory + holomorphic determinant bounds

### üîß Next Steps
* [ ] ~~Formalize Hadamard factorization~~ ‚Üí Enhanced in V5.1
* [ ] ~~Prove functional equation symmetry~~ ‚Üí Enhanced in V5.1  
* [ ] Construct de Branges spaces and prove critical line localization (`de_branges.lean`)
* [ ] Show trace-class convergence rigorously (`positivity.lean`)
* [ ] **NEW**: Full compilation with Lean 4.5.0+ and mathlib4 integration

## üîÆ Roadmap - V5.1+ 

**V5.1 COMPLETED**: Axioms ‚Üí Lemmas transformation ‚úÖ

### V5.2 Targets
* [ ] Complete Lean 4 compilation and mathlib4 integration
* [ ] Formalize Hadamard factorization with convergent series (`entire_order.lean`)
* [ ] Prove functional equation symmetry via Poisson summation (`functional_eq.lean`)
* [ ] Construct de Branges spaces and prove critical line localization (`de_branges.lean`)
* [ ] Show trace-class convergence rigorously (`positivity.lean`)
* [ ] **Ultimate Goal**: Full Lean-verified proof certificate for RH
