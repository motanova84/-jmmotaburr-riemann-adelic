# Lean Formalization

This folder contains stubs for formal verification of the adelic RH framework.

## Modules

- `entire_order.lean`: Hadamard factorisation, Phragmén–Lindelöf bounds
- `functional_eq.lean`: Adelic Poisson summation and functional symmetry
- `arch_factor.lean`: Archimedean gamma factor (Weil index, stationary phase)
- `de_branges.lean`: Canonical system, Hamiltonian positivity
- `positivity.lean`: Weil–Guinand quadratic form positivity

Each file currently contains skeletal declarations (`def ... : Prop`) to be
refined into full formal proofs using Lean4 + mathlib.

## Structure

The formalization follows the mathematical framework described in the main paper:
- **S-finite adelic systems** with proven lemmas A1 (finite scale flow), A2 (symmetry), A4 (spectral regularity)
- **Construction of D(s)** as entire function of order ≤1
- **Functional symmetry** D(1-s) = D(s)
- **Uniqueness via Paley-Wiener** identifying D ≡ Ξ
- **Riemann Hypothesis derivation** as mathematical consequence

## Dependencies

These Lean files depend on:
- Lean4 with mathlib
- Complex analysis library
- Number theory components (zeta function)
- Functional analysis (operator theory, trace class)
- Special functions (gamma function)

## Development Status

Currently in **stub phase** - all definitions are placeholders (`sorry`) awaiting full formal implementation. The structure provides a roadmap for systematic formalization of the adelic proof framework.
