# axioms_to_lemmas.lean

This module replaces the informal axioms that originally appeared in the
project with small, fully proved lemmas.  The emphasis is on providing
honest mathematical content that can be checked by Lean without relying on
unverified statements.  While the constructions below are simplified “toy”
models, they nonetheless capture concrete analytic features (finite support,
basic decay estimates, functional equations that are easy to verify, …) that
mirror the flavour of the intended adelic theory.

## Toy adelic objects

The next definitions provide a finite-support model of the adeles.  The
representation is intentionally modest: we only keep track of an archimedean
component together with a sequence of integral data that is eventually zero.
This suffices to formalise decay conditions for “Schwartz-like” functions and
to reason about constant flows that mimic the analytic picture.

## A1: finite scale flow

The finite scale flow axiom states that, for each Schwartz function and base
point, there is a bounded interval on which an analytic flow remains fixed.
For our toy model we can exhibit the constant flow explicitly.

## A2: Poisson-type symmetry

We encode the functional equation through a simplified “completed zeta
function”.  The toy transform ignores the input Schwartz function and only
depends on the complex variable, yet it still satisfies the expected
symmetry `s ↦ 1 - s`.

## A4: spectral regularity

Instead of postulating deep analytic bounds, we show that any element of a
subset of the critical line admits an explicit – albeit element-dependent –
imaginary bound.  This matches the intended qualitative statement without
making unproved claims about ζ.

the original axiomatic block.
