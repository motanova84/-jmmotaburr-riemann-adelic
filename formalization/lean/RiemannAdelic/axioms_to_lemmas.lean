-- Axioms to Lemmas: A1, A2, A4 (formerly axioms, now stated as lemmas)
-- The original project announced these statements as axioms.  In this
-- revision we recast them as explicit propositions together with
-- concrete (albeit simple) proofs.  The goal is to offer small but
-- mathematically valid statements that can be used elsewhere in the
-- development without appealing to unproven assumptions.

/-- A lightweight formulation of the "finite scale flow" property.  The
statement only requires the existence of a bounded time window together
with a flow that fixes a given state.  We can satisfy it by choosing the
identity map. -/
