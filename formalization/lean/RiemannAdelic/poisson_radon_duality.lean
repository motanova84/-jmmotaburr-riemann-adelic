Poisson-Radón Duality and Geometric Principles
===============================================

This module formalizes the geometric principle of Poisson-Radón duality
and its application to deriving the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function.

The key idea is that the involution operator J imposes symmetry s ↔ 1-s,
which forces the local Gamma factors Γ_R and Γ_C by uniqueness.

Note: This is a conceptual formalization. Full implementation would require
additional Mathlib infrastructure for adelic structures.

/-! ## Notes and Documentation

This formalization captures the key geometric principles:

1. **Involution J**: The operator J : f ↦ |x|^(-1/2) f(1/x) is self-inverse (J² = Id)

2. **Poisson-Radón Duality**: Relates sums over lattices to Fourier transforms,
   establishing position-momentum duality in the adelic setting

3. **Functional Equation**: The symmetry s ↔ 1-s follows from J-invariance

4. **Gamma Factors**: The local factors Γ_R and Γ_C are uniquely determined
   by the requirement that they transform appropriately under J

5. **Spectral Connection**: The eigenvalues of the associated operator H
   correspond to the zeros of ζ(s)

## Implementation Strategy

To make this fully executable in Mathlib4, one would need:

- Formalization of adelic spaces and local fields
- Haar measure on adelic groups
- Poisson summation on lattices
- Tate's thesis framework
- Spectral theory for unbounded operators

The current formalization provides the conceptual structure that can be
filled in as Mathlib's adelic infrastructure develops.
