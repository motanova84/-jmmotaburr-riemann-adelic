The Riemann Hypothesis stands as one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, asserting that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\Re(s) = 1/2$. Despite numerous attempts spanning over 160 years, a complete proof has remained elusive.

This paper presents a novel approach based on \emph{S-finite adelic spectral systems}â€”a framework that emerges from the intersection of spectral theory, adelic analysis, and operator theory. Rather than beginning with the classical Euler product definition of $\zeta(s)$, we construct a canonical determinant $D(s)$ from first principles using operator-theoretic methods.

\subsection{Main Contributions}

Our principal contributions are threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Canonical Construction}: We define $D(s)$ via a scale-invariant flow over abstract places, smoothed through double operator integrals, without presupposing the structure of $\zeta(s)$.

\item \textbf{Spectral Framework}: We establish that $D(s)$ satisfies the key analytical properties (entire function of order $\leq 1$, functional equation, normalization) and prove its identification with the completed Riemann xi-function $\Xi(s)$.

\item \textbf{Dual Proof Strategy}: We employ both the de Branges theory of Hilbert spaces of entire functions and the Weil-Guinand positivity methods to establish that zeros must lie on the critical line.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structure of the Paper}

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 establishes the axiomatic foundation and spectral system. Sections 3-7 develop the core theoretical framework, including archimedean rigidity, uniqueness theorems, and the critical localization result. The appendices provide detailed technical proofs and numerical validation.
