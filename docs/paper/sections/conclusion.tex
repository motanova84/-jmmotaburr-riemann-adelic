\section{Conclusion}

We presented an adelic framework with the following results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Axioms A1--A4 are derived from Schwartz--Bruhat factorisation, adelic Poisson summation, and Birman--Solomyak trace theory.
    \item The Archimedean factor is rigidly determined as $\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)$ by independent Weil-index and stationary-phase calculations.
    \item Paley--Wiener--Hamburger uniqueness forces $D(s)$ to coincide with $\Xi(s)$.
    \item de Branges and Weil--Guinand positivity routes place every zero of $D$ on the critical line.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Status and limitations}
The arguments rely on classical adelic analysis, spectral positivity, and standard
regularity assumptions (e.g. decay of Schwartz--Bruhat functions and integrable
Hamiltonians).  A complete publication must document the analytic details of the
kernel estimates, the limit-point verification for the canonical system, and the
control of the quadratic form $Q[f]$ for truncated test functions.  These points
are highlighted as priorities for peer review and future formal verification.

This repository serves as a public, reproducible framework to advance towards a
complete proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
