\section{Conclusion}

The present notes assemble the ingredients of an adelic programme aimed at
deriving the Riemann Hypothesis.  At this stage they should be read as a
research blueprint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sections on A1--A4, the Archimedean factor, and Paley--Wiener
    uniqueness record the classical routes by which these properties are
    expected to follow from Schwartz--Bruhat theory, Poisson summation, and
    Hadamard factorisation.
    \item The de Branges and Weil--Guinand sections describe how spectral
    positivity might enforce critical-line zeros once the required operator and
    quadratic-form estimates are proved.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outstanding analytic work}
The key analytic closures remain open.  In particular we still require:
\begin{itemize}
    \item detailed proofs that the adelic flow construction forces A1--A4
    without auxiliary axioms (Deliverables P1.1--P1.4),
    \item a complete verification of the canonical system's limit-point
    behaviour and self-adjointness, plus sharp bounds establishing positivity of
    the Weil--Guinand quadratic form (Deliverables P2.1--P2.4),
    \item two independent derivations of the Archimedean factor fixing
    $\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)$ (Deliverables P3.1--P3.2), and
    \item publication-ready documentation together with mechanised verification
    of the argument (Deliverables P4.1--P4.4).
\end{itemize}

Until these steps are completed, the project remains a conditional framework
rather than a universally accepted proof.
