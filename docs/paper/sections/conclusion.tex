\section{Conclusion}

We presented an adelic framework with the following results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Derivation of Axioms A1--A4 as lemmas from standard adelic theory.
    \item Rigidity of the Archimedean factor.
    \item Uniqueness via Paley--Wiener.
    \item Analytical routes (de Branges, Weil--Guinand positivity) for critical line location.
\end{itemize}

At present, the demonstration is conditional: some proofs remain in progress 
(specifically the full analytical closure of zeros on the critical line). 
This repository serves as a public, reproducible framework to advance towards
a complete proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
