\section{Introduction}

The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is one of the central open problems in mathematics. 
In this work we present an adelic framework which constructs an entire function $D(s)$
of order $\leq 1$, with functional symmetry, normalized and identified with the Riemann $\Xi$ function.
The goal is to derive RH as a consequence of structural properties of $D$.
