**Title:** Adelic Framework Towards a Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis  
**Author:** José Manuel Mota Burruezo

Dear Editor,

Please find enclosed the manuscript *Adelic Framework Towards a Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis*.  The article presents a unified adelic approach in which the classical axioms A1--A4 are derived from Tate's zeta integrals, the Archimedean factor is determined uniquely, Paley--Wiener--Hamburger uniqueness forces identification with the completed Riemann function, and de Branges/Weil--Guinand positivity arguments pin all zeros to the critical line.

The submission emphasises the following contributions:

1. **Intrinsic derivation of axioms.**  The Schwartz--Bruhat factorisation, adelic Poisson summation with Weil index, and Birman--Solomyak trace theory remove ad hoc assumptions from the construction of $D(s)$.
2. **Archimedean rigidity.**  Both Weil-index and stationary-phase derivations deliver the same $\\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)$ factor, eliminating normalisation ambiguities.
3. **Spectral uniqueness.**  A Paley--Wiener--Hamburger lemma and the de Branges canonical system guarantee that $D(s)$ shares all structural data with $\\Xi(s)$.
4. **Critical-line localisation.**  Positivity of the canonical Hamiltonian and of the Weil--Guinand quadratic form implies that every zero of $D$ lies on $\\Re(s)=\\tfrac{1}{2}$.

The work departs from classical treatments by avoiding the Euler product and by combining adelic harmonic analysis with operator-theoretic positivity to reach the critical line.  All derivations are accompanied by proof-check scripts and continuous integration workflows to facilitate independent verification.

The manuscript is currently targeted at journals focused on analytic number theory and spectral theory (e.g. *Journal d'Analyse Mathématique*, *International Mathematics Research Notices*).  An arXiv submission is also planned so that the community can reproduce the calculations and review the details openly.

Thank you for considering this submission.  I am happy to provide further clarifications or computational logs upon request.

Sincerely,
