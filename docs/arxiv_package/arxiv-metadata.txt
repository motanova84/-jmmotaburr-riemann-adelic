Title: A Complete Conditional Resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis via S-Finite Adelic Spectral Systems

Authors: José Manuel Mota Burruezo

Abstract: This paper presents a complete conditional resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis, based on a spectral framework built from S-finite adelic systems. We define a canonical determinant D(s), constructed from operator-theoretic principles alone, without using the Euler product or the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) as input. The determinant D(s) arises from a scale-invariant flow over abstract places, smoothed via double operator integrals, and satisfies: (1) D(s) is entire of order ≤ 1, (2) D(1-s) = D(s) by spectral symmetry, (3) normalization condition at infinity, (4) D(s) ≡ Ξ(s) where Ξ(s) is the completed Riemann xi-function. The trace formula derived from this system recovers the logarithmic prime structure as a geometric consequence of closed spectral orbits. This yields a conditional identification D(s) = Ξ(s), and thus a conditional proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
