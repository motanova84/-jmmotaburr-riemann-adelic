# Security Policy

## Protecting Intellectual Property

This repository contains original mathematical research on the Riemann Hypothesis (Version V5 — Coronación) by José Manuel Mota Burruezo. The work is protected by copyright and intellectual property laws.

## Automated Monitoring

We employ an **automated plagiarism detection and monitoring system** that:

- ✅ Generates cryptographic fingerprints of all research artifacts
- ✅ Monitors GitHub, Crossref, and other platforms for unauthorized use
- ✅ Detects exact copies and paraphrased content
- ✅ Collects evidence of potential infringement
- ✅ Runs continuously via automated workflows

### What is Monitored

- Research papers (PDF and LaTeX source)
- Key mathematical equations and formulas
- Code implementations
- Documentation and README files
- DOI and citation metadata
- Repository structure and content
