# Lean Formalization Status Correction

## Issue Summary

The repository documentation previously claimed that the Lean 4 formalization was "Completada" (completed) and "validado" (verified). This was misleading because:

1. The Lean files use `axiom` declarations instead of proven `theorem` statements
2. The main RH theorem uses `sorry` placeholder instead of actual proof
3. All Lean files are skeleton/framework code, NOT verified proofs checked by the Lean kernel

## Changes Made

### Documentation Updates

#### Main README Files
- **README.md**: Updated badges from "Completada" to "En Progreso (Skeleton)"
- **public/README.md**: Updated badges to reflect skeleton status
- **formalization/lean/README.md**: Added prominent warning about skeleton status

#### Status Documentation
- **validation_log.md**: Changed "COMPLETE" to "SKELETON" for all Lean modules
- **YOLO.md**: Changed "Complete proof" to "Framework only (uses axioms/sorry)"
- **QUICKSTART.md**: Updated FAQ answer to clarify Lean proofs are NOT complete
- **COMPREHENSIVE_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md**: Updated claims about formalization completeness
- **NON_CIRCULAR_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Clarified proof structure is skeleton only

### Source Code Updates

#### Lean Files
- **RiemannAdelic/axioms_to_lemmas.lean**: Added warning comments about axiom declarations
- **RH_final.lean**: Added warning that main theorem uses `sorry` and is NOT verified

## Current Accurate Status

### ⚠️ Lean Formalization: SKELETON/FRAMEWORK ONLY

**What EXISTS:**
- Structural outline of proof approach
- Type definitions for mathematical objects
- Comments with proof intentions and references
- Framework for future formalization work

**What DOES NOT exist:**
- Verified proofs checked by Lean kernel
- Theorems proven without axioms or sorry
- Machine-verified formal proof of Riemann Hypothesis

## Next Steps for Real Formalization

To make the Lean formalization real (not simulated), these steps are needed:

1. Replace all `axiom` declarations with `theorem` statements
2. Provide constructive proofs for all theorems (no `sorry`)
3. Ensure Lean kernel verifies all proofs successfully
4. Build the project with `lake build` without errors
5. Integrate with mathlib4 properly

## Impact

This correction ensures:
- ✅ Honest representation of project status
- ✅ No misleading claims about formal verification
- ✅ Clear distinction between skeleton code and verified proofs
- ✅ Accurate expectations for users and reviewers
