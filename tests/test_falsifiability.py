Falsifiability Tests for Riemann Hypothesis Proof Framework
V6.0 - Tests that would collapse if core assumptions fail

These tests are designed to fail if the underlying mathematical
framework has errors. They test critical assumptions:
1. ℓ_v = log q_v must hold exactly
2. Spectral regularity must be maintained
3. Extension to infinite must converge
4. Uniqueness must hold without reference to Ξ

If any assumption is wrong, these tests should fail.
